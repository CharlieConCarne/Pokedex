# Pokédex

A web-based Pokédex application that allows users to browse through all 1118 Pokémon with detailed information for each one.

Another beginner coding project, after diving deeper into JS and continuing to learn as much as I can, this project especially is focusing on API implementation and getting myself comfortable with fetching data.
